    <h1>Terms of Service for OpenDrop</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      These Terms of Service govern your use of the OpenDrop mobile application and associated desktop server software.
      By using OpenDrop, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section class="card">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Acceptance of These Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By downloading, installing, accessing, or using OpenDrop ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of
            Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Description of the Service</h2>
          <p>
            OpenDrop is a self-hosted, distributed file access system that helps you transfer and access files between
            your own devices (for example, between a mobile device and a personal desktop server). OpenDrop may use
            secure tunneling and authentication services to help your devices discover and connect to each other.
          </p>
          <div class="callout">
            OpenDrop is designed so your files remain on your devices. The Service facilitates transfer and access and
            does not provide general-purpose cloud storage for your files.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority in your
            jurisdiction, you may use the Service only with consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Accounts and Authentication</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Google Sign-In (Optional):</strong> Certain features (such as Cloud Sync) may require signing in
              with Google. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all
              activities that occur under your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shared Secret / API Key:</strong> Your desktop server may be protected by a generated shared secret
              or API key. You are responsible for safeguarding it and for any access that occurs using it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
          <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. For example, you will not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for illegal activities or to violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any systems, accounts, or networks.</li>
            <li>Interfere with, disrupt, or degrade the integrity or performance of the Service.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code except where prohibited by law.</li>
            <li>Use the Service to distribute malware, spyware, or other harmful content.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Your Files and Content</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Ownership:</strong> You retain ownership of your files and content. OpenDrop does not claim
              ownership of your files.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for the files you transfer, access, or
              share using OpenDrop, including ensuring you have all necessary rights and permissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Local Environment:</strong> Because the desktop server runs in your environment, you are
              responsible for securing your own devices, networks, and operating system configuration.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy describes how we collect and use information. By using the Service, you agree that we can
            process information as described in the Privacy Policy.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Subscriptions and Payments (OpenDrop Pro)</h2>
          <p>
            OpenDrop may offer paid features via a subscription ("OpenDrop Pro"). If you subscribe:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Billing:</strong> Subscription purchases may be processed through third-party payment platforms
              (such as Google Play or web payment providers). Your payment method and billing relationship are governed
              by the applicable provider’s terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions may automatically renew unless canceled before the renewal
              date, subject to your purchase platform’s rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Managing or Canceling:</strong> You must manage or cancel your subscription through the platform
              where you originally purchased it (for example, Google Play subscriptions for in-app purchases, or a web
              billing portal for web purchases).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Refunds:</strong> Refund requests are handled according to the purchase platform’s refund policy,
              except where required by applicable law.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>
            The Service may rely on third-party services to function (for example: tunneling, authentication, and
            subscription management). These providers may have their own terms and privacy policies, and your use of
            those services may be subject to their terms.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Updates, Changes, and Availability</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Updates:</strong> We may provide updates, patches, or modifications to the Service. Some updates
              may be required for continued use.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Changes:</strong> We may change or discontinue features at any time, including paid features, to
              maintain security, comply with law, or improve performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Availability:</strong> We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. Connectivity may be
              affected by your network, your device configuration, or third-party service availability.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Termination</h2>
          <p>
            You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access to the Service if we believe
            you have violated these Terms, if required by law, or to protect the integrity and security of the Service.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
          <p>
            THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

          </p>
          <p>
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE

            RISE TO THE CLAIM.
          </p>
        </li>

            We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice by posting
            the updated Terms on this page. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective means you
